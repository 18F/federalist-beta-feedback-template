  - text: This concept is a working prototype of Search Results and the Contract Summary pages. The DATA Act team is publishing this minimum viable product to give the public the opportunity to provide feedback on the design of the future USAspending.gov site.
  - text: <strong>Features of the Prototype</strong>
  - text: <em>Search Results</em> -- Select from a series of filters and the graphs, maps, and tables adjust to reflect the results from the selected filters.  
  - text: <em>Drill Downs</em> -- From the Spending by Award Type on the Search Results, you can drill down to data about specific Contracts.
  - text: Some of the features are currently placeholders that will be implemented at a later date as the team develops the future USAspending.gov platform.
  - text: <strong>The Data</strong>
  - text: Note that all data in the prototype is notional and does not represent actual spending data. Currently, the data includes a small subset of awards data and a small subset of financial data from select DATA Act Broker submissions.
  - text: We recommend that you view the individual concepts for the <a class="usa-cta" href="../search-results">search results page</a> and the <a class="usa-cta" href="../contract-summary">contract summary</a> to better understand the intended functionality.
