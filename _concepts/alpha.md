headline: Search Results & Contract Award Page

copy:
  - text: This concept is actually a working prototype of the Search Results and Contract Award pages. It represents the minimum viable product necessary to get feedback from the public. All data contained in the prototype is notional and does not represent actual spending data. Additionally, many intended features are currently placeholders, but will be implemented at a later date. We recommend that you view the individual concepts for the <a class="usa-cta" href="../search-results">search results page</a> and the <a class="usa-cta" href="../contract-summary">contract award summary</a> to better understand the intended functionality.
