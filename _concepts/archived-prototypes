  - text: This concept is a working prototype of the Home Page, Search Results, Contract Summary, and Grant Summary pages. The DATA Act team is publishing this minimum viable product to give the public the opportunity to provide feedback on the design of the future USAspending.gov site.
  - text: <strong>Features of the Prototype</strong>
  - text: <em>Home Page</em> -- Your introduction to how the government spends money, from the total for one year to a breakdown by categories such as Social Security and National Defense. Immediate access to search. 
  - text: <em>Search Results</em> -- Select from a series of filters and the graphs, maps, and tables adjust to reflect the results from the selected filters.  
    - text: <em>Contract Summary</em> -- From the Spending by Award Type on the Search Results, you can drill down to data about specific Contracts.
   - text: <em>Grant Summary</em> -- Drill down from the Spending by Award Type on the Search Results to find information about  specific Grants. 
   - text: Some of the features are currently placeholders that will be implemented at a later date as the team develops the future USAspending.gov platform.
  - text: <strong>The Data</strong>
  - text: Note that all data in the prototype is notional and does not represent actual spending data. Currently, the data includes a subset of awards data and a subset of financial data from select DATA Act Broker submissions.
  - text: We recommend that you view the individual concepts for the <a class="usa-cta" href="../home-page">home page</a><a class="usa-cta" href="../search-results">search results page</a>, the <a class="usa-cta" href="../contract-summary">contract summary</a>, and the <a class="usa-cta" href="../grant-summary">grant summary</a>to better understand the intended functionality.
