  - text: This concept is a working prototype of the Search Results page. The DATA Act team is publishing this minimum viable product to give the public the opportunity to provide feedback on the design of the future USAspending.gov site.
  - text: <strong>Features of the Search Results Prototype</strong>
  - text: Select from a series of filters and the graphs, maps, and tables adjust to reflect the results from the selected filters. Drill down to details on specific contracts and grants.
  - text: Some of the features are currently placeholders that will be implemented at a later date as the team develops the future USAspending.gov platform.
  - text: <strong>The Data</strong>
  - text: Note that all data is notional and does not represent actual spending data. Currently, the data includes a subset of awards data and a subset of financial data from select DATA Act Broker submissions.
  - text: We recommend that you view the individual concept for the <a class="usa-cta" href="../search-results">search results page</a>, to better understand the intended functionality.
