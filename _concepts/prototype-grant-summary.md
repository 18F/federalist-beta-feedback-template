  - text: This concept is a working prototype of the Grant Summary page. The DATA Act team is publishing this minimum viable product to give the public the opportunity to provide feedback on the design of the future USAspending.gov site.
  - text: <strong>Features of the Grant Summary</strong>
  - text: Drill down from the Spending by Award Type on the Search Results to find information about specific Grants. 
  - text: Details include recipient information, type of business, total award amount, description of the project, and type of grant.
  - text: Toggle to see awarding agency and funding agency. 
  - text: Some of the features are currently placeholders that will be implemented at a later date as the team develops the future USAspending.gov platform.
  - text: <strong>The Data</strong>
  - text: Note that all data in the prototype is notional and does not represent actual spending data. Currently, the data includes a subset of awards data and a subset of financial data from select DATA Act Broker submissions.
  - text: We recommend that you view the individual concepts for the <a class="usa-cta" href="../grant-summary">grant summary</a>to better understand the intended functionality.
