  - text: This concept is a working prototype of the Contract Summary. The DATA Act team is publishing this minimum viable product to give the public the opportunity to provide feedback on the design of the future USAspending.gov site.
  - text: <strong>Features of the Contract Summary</strong> 
  - text: From the Spending by Award Type on the Search Results, you can drill down to data about specific Contracts.
  - text: Graphic comparing the current award amount and the potential award amount. 
  - text: Details about the contract, including the recipient, the type of contract, and the period of performance.   
  - text: Some of the features are currently placeholders that will be implemented at a later date as the team develops the future USAspending.gov platform.
  - text: <strong>The Data</strong>
  - text: Note that all data in the prototype is notional and does not represent actual spending data. Currently, the data includes a subset of awards data and a subset of financial data from select DATA Act Broker submissions.
  - text: We recommend that you view the individual concept for the <a class="usa-cta" href="../contract-summary">contract summary</a> to better understand the intended functionality.
